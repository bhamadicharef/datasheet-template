LaTeX document class for creating electronics data sheets
=========================================================

This repository contains a document class for the LaTeX typesetting
system. It can be used to create good looking data sheets for electronic
components.

Inside the repository there is the [datasheet.cls](datasheet.cls) document
class file and an example document [example.tex](example.tex).

You can see an example of the output in [example.pdf](example.pdf).

To build, run:

    latexmk -pdf

While the basics are in place, this document class is still fairly new and
real life usage will no doubt show what's still missing. Feel free to send
pull requests for improvements.
